    "# Predicting the winner of the 2018 FIFA World Cup\n",
    "**Aim**: \n",
    "to predict the outcome of the FIFA World Cup 2018\n",
    "\n",
    " **Method**:\n",
    "- Use data from Kaggle to model the outcome of certain pairings between teams, given their rank, points, and the weighted point difference with the opponent.\n",
    "- Use this model to predict the outcome of the group rounds and then the single-elimination phase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "According to the analysis below, the team that will win the World Cup is the [underdog according to the bookies](https://www.oddschecker.com/football/world-cup/winner): Germany . But this is not the only interesting thing you can observe. If [not interested in the data munging part](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.441592463.7099/sticker,375x360-bg,ffffff.u1.png) head to the last section (Visualization) and see the single-elimination phase. To make the story more interesting for the sport lovers, I report fair odds (i.e. fair market, without bookmaker margin) instead of the raw probability output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Couple things to note, \n",
    "- it seems Egypt qualifies to the best 16 and their match with Portugal is the safest bet in the phase. \n",
    "- In this simulation, Brasil cannot make it through Belgium.. I'm sure here many would consider otherwise\n",
    "- It seems that neither CRonaldo (POR) nor LMessi (ARG) is going to play in the final but they are going to play against each other in the quarterfinals...\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, I'm looking forward to the tournament! Place your bets and get ready you too! \n",
    "\n",
    "Cheers!"
